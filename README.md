# 🧠 Customer Segmentation with K-Means, DBSCAN & Hierarchical Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a fundamental task in business analytics, enabling companies to better understand their customer base and design targeted marketing strategies. In this project, we apply **unsupervised learning** techniques—specifically **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering**—to segment wholesale customers based on annual spending across various product categories.

This analysis helps uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior, supporting data-driven decision-making for product planning, customer engagement, and sales strategies.

## 🧾 Dataset Information

The dataset originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) and contains spending information from a wholesale distributor across multiple regions and channels.
